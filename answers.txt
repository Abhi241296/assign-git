Q: What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A: If Master has not diverged, instead of creating a new commit, git will just point master to the latest commit of the feature branch. This is a “fast forward.” There won't be any "merge commit" in fast-forwarding merge.

Q: Why should you have different branches?
A: Branches keep all the new work separate from the work previously done and tested. It helps in making sure that if one commit on a branch fails the whole system currently working doesn't crash.

Q: In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A: You can have any number of git remote repositories you want but only one can be named the 'origin'. Also having multiple remotes means you need to push changes to all the remotes. So generally projects use one remote if it isn't really necessary to have more than one remote repository but you can have more than one if you want.
